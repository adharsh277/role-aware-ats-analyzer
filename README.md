  "score": 68,
  "missing_keywords": ["tensorflow", "statistics"],
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider adding experience with tensorflow",

The system scans resume text

Matches keywords against predefined role skill maps

Selects the role with highest relevance

Scores only against that role

This makes the system:

Free

Explainable

Deterministic
